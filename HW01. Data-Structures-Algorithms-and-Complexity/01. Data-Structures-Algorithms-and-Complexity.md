## Data Structures, Algorithms and Complexity Homework

#### 1. What is the expected running time of the following C# code?
  - Explain why using Markdown.
  - Assume the array's size is `n`. 

  ```c#
  long Compute(int[] arr)
  {
      long count = 0;
      for (int i=0; i<arr.Length; i++) 
      {
          int start = 0, end = arr.Length-1;
          while (start < end) 
              if (arr[start] < arr[end])
                  { start++; count++; }
              else 
                  end--;
      }
      return count;
  }
  ```
	
#####Answer: 
The expected running time is `O(n^2)` because outer cicle has `n` iterations and inner cicle has `n-1` iterations and the running time is `n*(n-1)=n^2-n` but the effect of `n` is minimal so the result running time is `O(n^2)`

####2. What is the expected running time of the following C# code?
  - Explain why using Markdown.
  - Assume the input matrix has size of `n * m`.

  ```c#
  long CalcCount(int[,] matrix)
  {
      long count = 0;
      for (int row=0; row<matrix.GetLength(0); row++)
          if (matrix[row, 0] % 2 == 0)
              for (int col=0; col<matrix.GetLength(1); col++)
                  if (matrix[row,col] > 0)
                      count++;
      return count;
  }
  ```

#####Answer: 
In best-case scenario the algorithum running time would be `O(n)`, because the inner loop wuld never be reached.

In average-case scenario the algorithum running time would be `O(n*m)`, because the inner loop would be executed `n/2` times but `(n/2)*m` is still `O(n*m)` running time.

In worst-case scenario the algorithum running time would be `O(n*m)`, because the inner loop would be executed `n` times.

####3. (*) What is the expected running time of the following C# code?
  - Explain why using Markdown.
  - Assume the input matrix has size of `n * m`.

  ```c#
  long CalcSum(int[,] matrix, int row)
  {
      long sum = 0;
      for (int col = 0; col < matrix.GetLength(1); col++) 
          sum += matrix[row, col];
      if (row + 1 < matrix.GetLength(0)) 
          sum += CalcSum(matrix, row + 1);
      return sum;
  }
  
  Console.WriteLine(CalcSum(matrix, 0));
  ```
#####Answer: 
Running time will be `O(n^m)` because for loop iterates `m` times every time the function is called and the function is called `n` times.
